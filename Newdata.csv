"R1MI8HNTIFTDYT","Arnav","____________________Technical Specifications---------------------------------Here's the technical information of Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones. The information provided below is as per the manufacturer. Boat BassHeads 225 have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. It Features 10 mm drivers. Rated Impedance of 16 ohms. Comes with 1.2 meter Flat Tangle Free Cable. 3.5 mm Gold-Plated L-Shaped Audio Jack (90 degrees). Sensitivity : 98 dB+/-3 dB.____________________Built Quality & Design---------------------------------I was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, Boat BassHeads 225 are fully made up of metal. It has a diagonal grid-like texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. The metal construction gives Boat BassHeads 225 a premium feel & attractive appearance. The cable used by Boat on BassHeads 225 is Flat with rubberized coating, it is a tangle-free cable & does it's job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. Despite the metal construction, Boat BassHeads 225 are very lightweight & comes with a microphone & L-Shaped 3.5 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. Overall the built quality is excellent for the price & seems very durable. The ear buds have proper L & R labels and are clearly visible. Boat BassHeads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed out-of-the-box.___________Audio Quality-------------------To ensure that I can test the BassHeads 225 at their uppermost limit, I used high-quality MP3 files of 320 kbps & Lossless audio formats like FLAC & WAV. For smartphone listening, I used Poweramp music player & tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. For the computer, I used iTunes player & VLC Audio player. I also tested these earphones on Apple iPod, iPhone & Sony MP3 Player. All this went for more than 10 days & finally, I had my results.Boat BassHeads 225 promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. During my tests with them, I found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, I saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. The treble was again very good, the high-frequency sounds were clear & pleasant to ears. The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads 225 was decent. When listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.______________________Noise Isolation & Comfort-------------------------------------When it comes to Noise Isolation, Boat BassHeads 225 are very good at it, They come with medium sized ear tip pre-installed which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, I wasn't able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely & delivered an immersive experience. Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation & comfort. Overall Boat BassHeads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff & somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. Since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now & then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didn't happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now & then while running (maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it), An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it. When using BassHeads 225 with Ear Hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as I got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.-----------------------------------------Flat Cable & Microphone-----------------------------------------The cable is great, I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free & comes with a rubberized coating. The cable does its job well. The microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. During calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick up/reject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. It can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads 225.____________________Warranty & Price---------------------------------Boat BassHeads 225 comes with standard One Year Warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty._____________Final Thoughts!----------------------I've personally used Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones for more than two weeks (average daily two hours of listening) before writing this review and I'm pretty much impressed with them. I'm personally a fan of Extra Bass IEM's and currently, my primary IEM is Sony MDR-XB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category. Comparing Sony MDR-XB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didn't disappoint me, obviously it doesn't stand a chance in front of Sony MDR-XB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225 & the quality they offer, I was really very impressed.Boat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices & music players, I can say that they're amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. The bass output is amazing and is very intense, I'll recommend using correct size ear tips & good quality music player like Poweramp (Android) for better bass output. The treble is good & vocals are average, somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. The mids are again average.*****************************My Rating : 4 out of 5*****************************____________________The Verdict---------------------------------Taking everything into account, overall I'm very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225. The Built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass & good overall soundstage. Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids & highs. Overall the vocal & highs are good & mids are average but still good for the price. I'll recommend these IEM's to bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price. Genres like EDM, Rock, Hip-Hop sound really great on them. Boat BassHeads 225 justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.HOPE I HELPED YOU.THANKS","Reviewed in India on 27 January 2018","The best earphones you can find out there under 500 Bucks..???

"R24D2Z53GB3HXF","Fitness Freak","I bought these headphones after reading lot of positive reviews, thought i would share my personal review about the product to help other buyers.Product I received had a defective microphone and aweful amazon delivery that is why I am rating this product based on only product quality.I am going to give review based on what Manufacturer promised in Headphone description vs My experience.1) boAt BassHeads 225 polished metal earphones are designed to give you an experience which no other brand can match.My Exp - Design is solid and comes with polished metal earphones and they are right when they say in this price range (RS 449), no other brand is offering quality like this right now.2) It has an incredible sonic clarity with """"Super Extra Bass"""".My Exp - These earphones do offer extra bass without any doubt.3) It is not a plastic earphone - It is polished metal. With tangle free flat cables, you are expected to be hassle free.My Exp - It does have a Hard build and Durability. Made up of hard polished metal and tangle free strong flat cables.4) As the headphones feature 10mm drivers, they give you clear sound with that thumping bass.My Exp - Headphones without a doubt do offer clear thumping Bass. Half phone volume is loud enough for ears.5) In-built noise cancelling mic ensures you don't miss those important calls.My Exp - I wasn't able to test the MIC as the product I received had a defective Mic, So i requested a refund.6) With colors that match your style in your day, the boAt earphones are the ideal choice for anyone who can carry that attitude. Just plug them in and plug into nirvana.My Exp - They do offer 3 variety in colors and do look classy. If you are confused over which color to pick. If you like really bright colors go with RED. If you are a all day Black color Lover, there is option for BLACK and BLUE color is something in the middle which makes your earphones look more classy.Other Experience :1) I liked the over all design of the product it does look classy and give you good Bass. Comes with enough accessories like 5 multiple sized extra pairs of eartips and to help you get the right match, holding clip and a pair of ear hooks.Cons - Eartips & Ear Hooks could have been softer, ears do start to pain after 15-20 mins of playtime which makes it really irritating.2) Has Single Button which can do multiple actions.*Single Tap = Accepting/Disconnecting call & Play/Pause.*Double Tap = Play next song.Cons - Volume cant be controlled with this button, you will have do it manually using the phone buttons.3) It has L shaped 3.5 mm jack with a solid build which has more durability compared to regular straight jacks.Cons - This jack dont have a good fit and pop out everytime you move, if you use standard covers. Only solution i could find is, use a very thin cover or a cover which has big 3.5 jack hole point which hardly anyone offers or last resort, you can go coverless.Overall - If you are looking for a good build earphones to listen to loud music with good bass & dont really care about the comfort. This is the best bet you will get in this price range. But if you prefer comfort, This earphones is not such a good idea. you will soon get irritated and look for something better like I have.Amazon Delivery Feedback - Usually this doesn't happen but my delivery was delayed and I received the product with a defective mic, I had to make number of calls to get return pickup finally done and requested full refund from amazon, which they agreed to give.If this give helped you clear any doubts, please do give me helpful vote - It will motive me to share more reviews in future.","Reviewed in India on 29 March 2017","BASS so good you wont feel like taking them OFF.

I tried for several hours to put on the right size ones from the 10 pairs provided. the just don't stretch easily to mount on the earphone stub.

"R3SSF2AB38L3AR","Amazon Customer","This is a beast in this price range. I really have had a lot of earphones. Philips, Sony, Sennheiser, House of Marley, and yeah, Ubon. We all are budget oriented. And to be very honest. To me a earphone is a daily driver. And sound and its stability is like the biggest pro of a headphone. This earphone has it. Its sound is above average. And being so cheap, believe me it is cheap for the quality it produces. I have seen a lot of negative comments on these that they have a quite deprecating audio production comparing the Sennheiser, but to be honest the overall output is much more than the latter. These bassheadsh do produce less alluring mids but the highs and lows are above any other in this price ranger. And the build is an important aspect. If you spend thousands on a headphone or earphone and it is destroyed in some weeks or say months: that is wastage of money and the research. The boAt promises both sound and build. It is a beast. With all that we need. Metallic body with really very heavy drivers. Yeah sometimes it does take time to adjust it into your ears but after that its just awesome. The presence of so many earbuds and the choice to adjust them to your liking is super awesome. Yeah the extra hook they give is kind of annoying. Its of no use.The L joint of jack is really sturdy. With a bit of plastic(which is just decent ) and metallic ring to promise long life. It sure is one of the weakest point of a headphone/earphone. It is covered from damage, unless you really have intentions of breaking it.It has an anti-tangle wire. Lets call it a fair play. But still I would like to call it semi anti-tangle wire. As it does creates a fuss after being in a bag with other wires. Nice try.The drivers are good. Not going geeky on the specification sheets. But this really will up your game in audio perception. As promised bass is really a big gain in this. But yeah sometimes you want to hear a nice acoustic song which by no means sounds bad but really lacks that mid frequency. Not that it is a game changer. But still it makes it less ""complete"".(If you expect ""complete"" earphones also check your wallet, it needs to bleed much more than this.😂) Yeah Sennheiser is good at it. But it lacks the bass this beast produces. And the last but not the least it lacks(Sennheiser).....The bulid. The boAt has a build that was what I always wanted to be habitual with. All of a sudden the most ruthless men turn into a careful father of a young one at handling a headphone. But you need not worry in this department. boAt has got it covered it for you. It is a beast. Metallic body of the drivers. Above average Plastic(not gonna argue, the plastics could have been better.) Very nice wire. Which is almost tangle free. And has a very beautiful metallic splitter. The earbuds are good. But at such a budget friendly range it is a true beast.Buy this if you are a savage and want to have a better experience than the Chinese 30/- rupee earphones. And if you are a headphone terminator. Try it, if you want to have a long relationship with a audio device. And also know Sennheiser is a king in audio market and this brand is a growing bud. Audio is great but with the build it becomes the best in this range. And pair it with a Mi device, you will plug into nirvana!(built-in EQ of Mi is dope for in ear earphones.)*writing this after 3 months of rigorous use. 👍😀","Reviewed in India on 15 March 2018","Its a beast.(boo Sennheiser and Philips!)","4.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61OmYMG-toL.jpg

"R5DPR7G5O3RRS","Nishanth Rao","Pros:  Super Extra Bass: These headphones are designed to deliver enhanced bass response, making them ideal for bass enthusiasts who enjoy genres like hip-hop, EDM, and rock.  Comfortable Fit: The in-ear design comes with multiple earbud sizes, ensuring a snug and comfortable fit for extended listening sessions.  Built-in Microphone: The integrated mic allows for hands-free calling and voice commands, adding convenience for users on the go.  Lightweight Design: The lightweight construction makes them easy to wear for long periods without causing discomfort.  Stylish Look: The sleek black design gives these headphones a modern and stylish appearance, appealing to a wide range of users.Cons:  Wired Connection: As wired headphones, they may restrict movement compared to wireless options, which might be inconvenient for active users.  Average Noise Isolation: While the in-ear design provides some noise isolation, it may not fully block out external sounds, especially in noisy environments.  Durability Concerns: Some users may find that the build quality is decent but may not be as robust as higher-end models, potentially leading to wear over time.  Bass-Heavy Tuning: While the extra bass is a plus for some, users who prefer a more balanced sound profile might find the bass overwhelming.","Reviewed in India on 13 October 2024","With a comfortable fit and convenient features, they are a great choice for users","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0",,,
"RYJDE3KJM5VS6","Naveen P Nair","I have been a fan of the boAt BassHeads 225 since I first used the older model back in 2018. Recently, I decided to purchase this model again, primarily for its unmatched sound quality, broad device compatibility, and impressive bass performance. The signature boAt sound, especially the deep, punchy bass, remains the standout feature that keeps me loyal to this product as a hardcore bass enthusiast.While I noticed that the build quality of the earbuds themselves has shifted from metal to plastic, the overall improvements in design make up for it. The new L-shaped jack features a more ergonomic, compact angle, and the reinforced joints have been significantly upgraded, addressing durability concerns from the older model. My previous pair worked well until joint weakness near the jack led to its eventual failure, a problem that now seems to be resolved.For those seeking budget-friendly earphones with exceptional bass and reliable performance across various devices, the boAt BassHeads 225 remains a top choice.","Reviewed in India on 8 December 2024","boAt BassHeads 225: Unmatched Bass with Improved Durability","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0",,,

"RAQR2OPK2063X","Vineet Thakur ","Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.In short I am the king of bad luck in this.Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled manBut still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.Ahh the moment let me share with you guys  she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.Whole night I will awake and very stressed.Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.I know her past she was love in some man.Who is more than  double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life  I am very good predictor.May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.","Reviewed in India on 2 November 2018","Price vs quality vs performance","5.0 out of 5 stars","","148",,,

"RITX4LN7OIK8B","Wrickzy","I have used several earphones over the years.. Some aged like fine wine and some of them were bad from the get go ..( also yeah, I burn them before judging them) ..Today I will compare a few headphones, namely Sony XB55AP, Sennheiser CX213, JBL C200SI, Bassheads 225, Bassheads 100 and Sennheiser CX180..Also I used them on my phone( with and without equalizer) and on PC with Sound Blaster Play!3(with its own control panel offcourse)..I mainly judge them on several factors, 1. Sound Clarity 2. Bass 3. Loudness 4. Durability 5.Mic quality 6. Wearing ComfortNow comparing them,Descriptions:Sony XB55AP: though people speak highly of this headphone, but according to me, though the sound clarity is good, the bass may be overpowering at times. this headphone generates bass even in songs which has little bass to offer. though it sounds melodious at times, but sometimes, the thumping bass will feel annoying.Sennheiser CX213 and Sennheiser CX180: the sound clarity is excellent in both these earphones though, the CX213 has a little less bass and more sound clarity than its counterpart, the CX 180 which has a little less sound clarity. But more or less, both are the same.JBL C200SI: Excellent sound clarity and balanced bass.Bassheads 225: average sound clarity and the bass is overpowering mostly. the sound clarity is overwhelmed with the extra bass generated by the drivers.Bassheads 100: okish sound clarity and okish bass.Now,Factor 1: Sound Clarity: CX213=C200SI > CX180 = XB55AP >  Bassheads 225 > Bassheads 100Factor 2: Bass:  XB55AP > CX180 > Bassheads 225 > CX 213 = C200SI > Bassheads 100Factor 3: Loudness:  XB55AP > Bassheads 225 > CX180 = CX 213 = C200SI > Bassheads 100Factor 4: Durability: XB55AP = Bassheads 225 > C200SI > CX 213 > CX 180 = Bassheads 100Factor 5: Mic Quality: XB55AP > C200SI > Bassheads 225 = Bassheads 100Factor 6: Wearing Comfort : CX 213 = CX 180 > C200SI > Bassheads 100 > XB55AP > Bassheads 225","Reviewed in India on 23 October 2023","Only for people who likes more bass","2.0 out of 5 stars","","2",,"Forest Green","Without Carry Case"

Have to go to their service centre and get it repaired.Good thing isits wire-flat and easy to uncoil.The metal earpieces - amplify sound a little more.Jack is right angled-no issue of wire getting cut.Bass is good.Badthings are:heavy earpieces - falls off often.The earpiece are old fashioned, not ergonomic-no forward, downward, inward bending like newer earphones.wired is not a trend now, but no worry of battery low.No noise cancellationthe sound effect is reduced because the piece is not often aligned to ear canal, due to its weight it disaligns often.I was initially happy with this, but after using bluetooth true wireless earphones, didn't feel so good with this, also this starked giving problems now 6 month later.

But I started using that piece only a couple of months (in July-August), because I was already using 2 functional earphones. The RED ones STOPPED WORKING BY NOVEMBER even though they were used very sparingly.- Unfortunately, by that time, I had already purchased 2 more on 21st SEPT. Both those earphones have ENTIRELY STOPPED WORKING BY NOV.- I think the red one works erratically from one earpiece, but overall, all the pieces are now dysfunctional.In short, I have wasted a total of over Rs 2000/- on these fancy-looking earphones.Attached are pics of the three earphones that I have in my house.Now I use these as toys for my cats :)","Reviewed in India on 9 December 2017","POOR QUALITY PRODUCT","1.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51AkFlxyOlL.jpg

"RCC76IVFNSEPB","Our Father","Worth the go! The bass is insanely good for earphones.. Don't expect any more than this as earphones tend to be very close to eardrums and may damage it.. The sound has more treble or sharpness i guess its due to the heavy bass they had to make the earphone to produce more sharpness in music.. So music which has generally less bass will produce sharper tone. Might be irritating at times and will need an equalizer to fix it, but if you are a music freak that listens to songs with heavy bass this is the deal for you hands down.Edit: 3rd month the mic got busted due to sweat most probably.. Anyways i claimed warranty on 10th of April and today(10th may) it marks 30 days.. Got a mail from them that its gonna take another 4-7 days to process my product be it a replacement or a fix. So if you wanna use this earphone daily and worry bout warranty,don't bother to buy.. Nobody replies your email,their twitter is just for advertisement, and the helpline number keeps u waiting for 5-7mins until it hangs up with a msg saying ""sorry for inconvenience that we couldn't pick up ur call, but our customers are valuable so we will get back to you surely"" which they never did. Nobody picks up calls nobody calls back. Only lies and lies. Just pathetic servicing..No wonder how they make cheap but good music quality eaphones. Coz they are cutting short in after sales service which is equally important.","Reviewed in India on 19 September 2018","Superb bass and music quality 👍 WORST after sales service 👎","1.0 out of 5 stars","","72",,"Forest Green","Without Carry Case"

"R2ZCPAWVQSUGPF","Sneha Nair","So,this seems to be the latest trend on amazon.I have been receiving defective products continuously since the last 4-5 times i have been ordering.They don't even have the courtesy to repack it properly like in case of these earphones,they were just completely tangled and laid so untidily into the box that it was immediately a dead giveaway of the fact that they are used and most probably defective since someone must have returned them in such a state and then,they just repack it and sent it to me and i was absolutely correct as one side doesn't work at all as soon as i connected them to my phone and pc to check them for myself.Never expected amazon to do this...have been a loyal customer since so many yearrs but now my order history seems to be filled with replacement orders since almost always whatever i order tends to turn out to be defective.It's very clear that they try to recycle a defective product and expect atleast someone to accept the order without checking only to regret later on until it's too late!! Can't believe that within the last 2-3 months itself,i have gotten defective pulse oximeters,earphone splitters and earphones as well.. literally everything i have ordered within these last few months has had to be replaced.I am too disappointed!!Never expected this from amazon!!","Reviewed in India on 5 October 2020","Amzon has been sending nothing but defective products since the last 2-3 months","1.0 out of 5 stars","","0",,,
"R31X1Y6C4YJTO2","Viruss","This is an in depth review for anyone who's seriously considering to buy this.Split in to 3 category. 1 Build quality, 2 performance, 3 ergonomics.1. Build quality.Now I paid 499 for this and for that price I doubt if there's anything better. The driver housing is made of aluminum. It feels very premium in hand and to look at. The ear tip or the plugs are made of silicone just like any other. You get a total of 6 pairs of eartips of which 3 are S, M, L of black colour and 3 are same S, M, L of yellow with grey colour which does not match the cable colour. It just looks odd (I think they miss match it with the lime yellow's tips). You get additional pair of ear hooks and one cable clip. The cable clip is very useful for anyone who rides bike or does jogging which prevets the cable flying around and pulling the buds out. The aluminum housing is also a bit too heavy which adds unnecessary weight. Trust me, in case of earphones, the lighter the better. Now coming to the cable, they are flat tangle free type. It will get tangled if not wound properly but you will only spend 10 seconds to untangle it unlike 2-3 minutes as with the traditional ones. They are not serrated. But feels tough. It's definitely not as good as a braided cable but still good. Do keep them away from sharp objects. The plug is gold plated 90° L shape one. The plug insulation is not too thick( you don't have to make the hole of your case bigger to fully plug it in). The color is at least 2 tone lighter than what it's advertised making it more of disco green rather than forest green.2. PerformanceOverall impresssions are very good for the price. The lows (Bass) is above average but not that good considering that it's advertised as heavy Bass earphones. Mids are good and it's easy to make out different instruments. There's  noticable distortion in the high end if you are listening to music in a quiet room with 70% or above volume. I did burn in them for a good 15 hour and still the distortion didn't fade. The mic was of good quality and was at a good distance from ears so that it comes directly in front of your mouth. It didn't have difficulty in picking up the voice even when the mic was not directly in front of the mouth.3. ErgonomicsThis is where everything went south. I have used multiple Sony XB series earphones, Sennheiser, JBL, Apple earpods. This one even managed to top Apple on slipping out which is already bad. I don't know if it's an isolated situation with me but they just don't fit. I tried with every single combination of eartips and ear hooks and they slipped out within 20 second's if am sitting up straight. Oh by the way, those ear hooks are totally useless as they just stick out of the ear(I did try both direction). Again am not sure if it's an isolated situation.I used them just for the sake of review and had them returned after couple of days. Will surely let you guy's know about the next one soon.Do vote the review if you find it HELPFUL. ✌🤘","Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018","Detailed Review","2.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711PeaaMXAL.jpg

"R1JAMV7C4BGBTA","Akhi","The external packaging ie. boat box came with an opened seal on the top. I could see the once tampered seal and resealed on the other side. You can see the tampered seal mark on the left side of the picture and the seal that they put one the right side. The top lid of the package had all the creases and marks when I received the product just as if it was opened several times before. I paid all that money for something that might be returned and repacked and then was sent to me. I don't want to go through the hassle of sending it back, but I don't recommend buying earphones from this seller.As with the sound quality, In my opinion the sound quality is okayish, I find better sound quality with those JBL earphones that comes in similar price range more good. These earphones sounds a bit boxy, whereas JBL felt like more refined and fine tuned in my opinion and I don't usually use it high volumes. The stuff that goes into the ears are not exceptionally heavy, but it do tend to fall off of your ears after sometime of usage. The flat wire helps with detangling, and I hope this thing last me atleast for an year before replacement. I would have given this a solid 3.5 in terms of quality but but I am taking of one for the used package.","Reviewed in India on 14 August 2022","Received an open and resealed package","2.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DGHHzK2PL.jpg","0",,"Forest Green","With Carry Case"
"R3OISQ65T89DC8","Vivek","The product does not do justice to the high ratings. It is not as good as others make it seem. I am an audiophile and I have used tens of headphones and earphones, and it is one of the worst I have used.Pros1. It is not expensive and hence most can afford it.2. It has really good bass, and hence if that's the only thing you need, go ahead.3. It is sturdy as the earpieces are made of metal. Falling on the ground doesn't harm it any way. Even sitting on it by mistake won't do any damage. Better than plastic earpieces in that regard.Cons1. The sound quality is horrible after you go above 50% volume. It sounds like those cheap speakers in marriage halls.2. The volume at full capacity is very very loud, loud enough to make one partially deaf.3. The worst of it all. It is very heavy and hence starts hurting the ears within a few minutes of usage.4. It has very poor noise cancellation unless you literally stuff it inside your ear canal which hurts even more.5. It is definitely not a product for lon term usage as you will always have pain in your ear canal and may also damage your eardrums if played at higher volumes.Verdict - Buy Sennheiser, Sony or Philips,.may last less but you will enjoy the experience.","Reviewed in India on 28 April 2019","Don't buy this if you want to enjoy music","2.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mTJRpjn7L.jpg","5",,,

What am I expected to do if I want to use this while driving a bike? I cannot keep stopping and turning up/down the volume per song. Or if I bear with the higher volume when the song changes I stand the risk of becoming deaf gradually.It takes about 4 - 5 seconds for the Auto volume levelling to kick in.

The first one was very premium in terms of sound clarity and material of earphone. The first one has very rich sound and the wires and metal parts are solid as very premium and expensive earphone. After some time when I bought socond one because I was quite impressed with the quality but second one disappointed me, it came with degraded quality, less premium sound but I sacrificed. Now on 18/07/2018 when I bought third pair of this to gift someone I noticed the biggest downfall in their quality it was like a ₹50 Chinese earphones. Sound quality was lesser then a ₹50 roadside earphones, metal parts were less then half of weight then my first one, wires are cheap quality. Most importantly, sound doesn't feel like sound it's pretty much like unpleasant noise, very poor sound clarity, bad bass, increased price. Overall experience was lesser then my ₹50/- Chinese earphones. Please don't buy this latest version. If you find the old model somewhere then go for them.

"R3LBD368KEEVTO","abdul basit","Honestly, these earphones have pretty decent sound quality and many would call it very good especially for this price range and I dont disagree. My main issue is that the earbuds are long and heavy. And while build quality is good, it is extremely uncomfortable in many situations and tends to just fall off even after changing the earbud tip to suit my ear size.It Is also close to impossible to use just one earbud at a time, so if you want to share with a friend or for any reason want to keep only one on your ear, you'll have to keep it in with your hand, because it tends to fall easily due to the weight. If you want to use it in moving vehicles you may have to keep readjusting to make sure it does not fall off.And it is certainly not tangle proof and when it tangles, it seems to pull the earbuds down harder so you might  have to completely untangle it every time you want to use it.If u want to use earphones while running then this is definitely not the pair for you","Reviewed in India on 1 September 2019","Good sound, but very uncomfortable and heavy","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0",,,

The right one has has significantly low volume than the left.Secondly, All the songs sound half baked. The equalisation is terrible. Even after manually tweaking it, it isn't up to the standard.The sound also cracks a bit at high volumes, but that isn't very prominent.Another problem is the jack and phone connection. It is a little loose and impossible to put on with the phone cover (my cover's cut out has space to put in thicker earphone jacks, I've been using it for a year).Without the ear hooks, the earphones refuse to stay in my ear, which is pretty annoying because the hooks start hurting after a while.Coming to the positives, there aren't many.

You can simply buy any unbranded earpiece from a street side mobile shop and you'll get the same level of sound.In fact I strongly suggest you go for street side shops.

After about 7 months of daily use, sound stopped coming out of the left ear piece. I registered the product with the company and raise a ticket for a replacement, since it was within the warranty period. They took about 3 weeks to pickup the item and ship a replacement. However the replacement piece has stopped working (sound not coming out of right ear piece this time) after just 2 months of use.

The sound quality is not good and if you happen to turn up the volume accidentally your ears are for a hell of a high pitched ride.

I had used Scullcandy, Audio Technica in this Range but if struggles with the bass level, Means there is a solid Bass but still it doesn't sync with Treble. And Most Annoying thing of this earphone is that, there is no suppression of sound means the music you are listening will be audible to other Persons Nearby.Avoid this better to go with other options.","Reviewed in India on 8 January 2017","BOAT Bassheads 225 Review","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0",,,
"RKYOU37VCOPEC","Aditya Bhandari","This is not as much good as they claim it to be, i was using Philips ActionFit SHQ1200 before this and they had way much better quality than these(almost the same price)(been 3 years with Philips headset). I've also used skull candy headset at this price range even they were better in sound quality. These boat's headset are just loud and that's it, they don't even have that much quality bass, they will give you a headache with every shhh zzz sounds or vocals, they aren't clear at all. I made a mistake buying these headset but you shouldn't, it doesn't give you a good quality as per the price. The only perk it has is that they come with Mic and a good built tangle free cable, but if it's not gonna deliver good quality sound output then i don't see a point in buying them.

"RPXQ9LWZR03RQ","Kapil","So I am writing this review after about a month of usage...Bad things first: **BEWARE OF FAKE COPIES** at first, I purchased black coloures bass heads 220 from flipkart thinking that they were same as bassheads 225 and were 50 Rs. cheaper and DAMN that was a huge mistake... I got a fake copy of them and they were so precisely copied that i doubt anyone could tell the difference but there are a few things I can tell which distinguish original from fake ones..1. fake ones come in a smaller box which looks the same as the original one2. fake ones come with only one pair of extra ear buds whereas original ones come with 5 pair + earhooks + a collar clip3. the 3.5 mm jack of the fake ones is different from what they show in pics.. original one has a ""curved"" L shaped connector whereas fake one has a bulky and poor build connector..4. in the original ones, there are BOAT logos both on the mic and the cable splitter whears on fake ones, logo is only printed on cable splitter5. fake ones have almost no bass whereas real ones have heavy bassTHATS ALL I COULD FIND SO BEWARE OF FAKE COPIES... TO AVOID GETTING FAKE ONES, I RECOMMEND BUYING A DIFFERENT COLOUR THAN BLACK OR WHITE (BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY COLOURS THAT THEY COULD MAKE COPIES OF)continuing the review,second bad thing about this is that the eaphones itself are made of metal which is good but that makes them super heavy and they fall off your ears easily.. which is very annoying (you can use earhooks but they are not very comfortable)third bad thing is that the mesh that covers the earphone hole is very poorly glued and they completely rip off when you are trying to change eartips which is very very bad thing cuz if the mesh comes off, dust, water, sweat and even earwax could enter inside the speakers... which would eventually degrade your sound quality...COMING TO THE GOOD PART...as the name says BASS is veryyyy good and  heavy as well almost tooo heavy that it could rip off your ear drums... just kidding but still dont use them for too long on high volume...build quality is awesome with metal buds and gold plated jack..mic is okaayyish not too good and not bad either (good for pubg)...At the end I would still say that these are best eaphones in this price segment and if you like listening to bASS then go for it.. just be careful not to get fake ones cuz I have seen majority buyers got fake ones and the didn't even realise it LOL😂😂 and they still say it sounds good LMAO 😂thats all... glad if you find this helpful","Reviewed in India on 13 October 2020","beware of fake copies...","3.0 out of 5 stars","","3",,"Forest Green","Without Carry Case"
"R14FHWJGCSIFE2","RK","Guys I have been using these for 3 months after that i am my honest opinions. Do read it for sure cause it is gonna help you alot.1)First of all boat brand is something no body has heard of till mod 2016..let me tell you it is a not a standard company to rely upon because they have multiple products with same configuration and even same colors with multiple names.. Hats off boats for confusing people.. So u guys can decide what this company is all about2)secondly the quality of the product which in my opinion and all the users who i know use this  is given below :Build quality :4.5/5(very durable)Contents in box : 5/5(4pairs of buds of two colors  with some clips which no one gives in this price point)Main thing audio quality : 3/5Resoon for this:a) They say extra bass in the features  i dont understand that at all..........people want crystal clear vocals first then the bass in music.. U don't get clear audio in this.. Don't buy these for extra bass u can't be satisfied..b) high pitch is worst lows are not good to hear eitherc) SO OVERALL THEY DON'T GIVE A GOOD AUDIO EXPERIENCE WHICH YOU WANT FROM ANY EAR PHONEComfort of wearing them: 3.5/5This is because the ear buds provided are very hard and hurt your ear after 45mins of extended usageAnd also reinserting a new one to earphone is pain in ass cause they won't fit easily because of some problem in construction of earphoneProduct warranty:0/5they say there is warranty on this product..  Show a service center for this big brand and who will go to bangalore or parcel them to some distinct city for getting serviced if they buy for just 400/-Which only stupid ones do as they have to invest the same amount or more in traveling or parcelling..FORGET WARRANTY TOO3)If u want a better one and branded one go for Philips she1405 which were my primary one before this which cost less and give better audio quality output..

"R22KK93EW67KY0","Ryknex","If you look a pair of cheap good earphone as daily driver and rough usage, no wonder it DID cross your eyes.Me? As Introduction I have a history with with CX180, Piston 3, Rock Zircon in the past. And here goes my review for,'boAt Bass Heads 225 In-Ear Bass Headphones':Pros:1)Sturdy build quality. Hands down one of the best part of this earphone.  The metal and hard plastic finished capsule and the cable are fitted well enough to carry along with you to their work. jogging. travelling etc.2)A pleasant to look at it. I got the red one for me and yes it looks awesome and premium. it stands out quite enough.3)Price:Sound quality ratio. is justified.  I was a bit skeptical over The title on the box 'Super EXTRAAAA Bass' as I don't like 'too much bass' destroying  every other notes of the song/music. But the slight rumbling, extended bass delivered impressed me.  IDK if its for 'Bassheads' but its definitely not for flat listeners.  Soundstage is a bit below average.  The mids and the treble area are straight forward muddy, it doesn't have the sharpness there,  and the identification of individual instruments are muffled. Overall I'd give the sound quality a positive sign obviously  considering the price.4)The single Pause/Play button is embedded into the microphone chasis, so like the entire plastic body part is a  switch, you don't have search for the switch with your thumb.  And thumbs up for the L-shaped 3.5mm jack.5)Lastly, The packing is good. Expect a carrying pouch we get 3 sets of Black earbuds, 3 sells of Red-transparent earbuds.  A clip. Pair of clamp (to support into ear).  Using the black earbuds might provide you a little more comfort but I found the sound gets muffled a bitCons: Now sadly from here on in my review, everything goes downhill upto a really deal breaking point.1)Its UNCOMFORTABLE!!!. it hurts badly in my ear. No matter what earbuds I tried, with or without the clamp or  the clip, it hurts.  Specially when you are on the go, because of its long heavy metallic body of the earpieces.  Ok this experience should not be generalized, as some people out there might find a particular setup to achieve the proper  isolation, fit and comfort. but not me. And I CAN'T recommend this product in that regard.2)Isolation inside ear is poor, and as it hurts you can't put it into ear for long period also.3)The microphone is bad, you always have to keep it close to your mouth even in a relatively less noisy condition.  And no volume rocker.*)The Tangle-free wire is really tangle free but how it feels against the skin (specially when sweaty) is not as comfy as  the braided cable. Its a matter of choice what you like. personally I like the fabric textured braided cable over thisAlready sold this to a friend 2nd hand. So no further updates.Iif anyone is off to look for something else.I'd recommend checking 'Remax RM-610D'. Yes aesthetically and in build quality it might not be in a same level as this one.but it has volume rocker. Way better sound signature and comfortable fit in similar price bracket.","Reviewed in India on 29 November 2017","the 'boAt' didn't sail well","3.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614eiM0zGSL.jpg

"R2M1TOAZYPJ4EW","Amazonian","My review will be straight forward.....Pros :- Very loud volume , can make you go deaf easily at 60% Volume.- Really stylish looks, looks quite expensive- Build quality is excellent,  made of metal and the cords are tangle free....Heavy premium feel (Built to last).- Good for heavy metal and pop songs, where vocals are not quite the genre....Cons:- Only looks are good.... The sound is by far very terrible-  Very uncomfortable on the ear, even after 2 weeks of extemsive use... Ears start hurting after 30mins of use and the pain is really bad after u remove it from ears...- Poor fit , even with the ear hooks attached, often falls out due to the weight on the ear drivers....poor comfort- highs and mid often get distortion, and are not very pleasant to the ear... (feels like unwanted sound or noise... )- Volume is too loud, and always have to keep down the volume so as not not hurt the ears...- Bass is present, but lacking the thump feedback , which is absolutely bizarre aas it is marketed as Bass Heads......(Even the Rs.99 Philip's SHE1350 has better muds and highs and incredible bass compared to this)- Vocals are completely distorted at reasonable volumes too...TESTED ACROSS 15 DEVICES, BUT THEY SOUND BAD TOO EVEN AFTER TWEAKING VIA SOFTWARE APPS....SOUNDS DECENT ON MY DESKTOP COMPUTER THAT HAS A GOOD SOUND CARD AND HAD TO TWEAK TO GET REASONABLE RESULTS... FINAL VERDICT: Do not buy these earphones at all, at this price of 600, you can definitely get much better earphones that are comfortable and sound goodI suggest you to check out the Philips SHE 1350(Rs.99)  as they have Amazing Bass and Unbelievably good Mid and Highs under 500.( But is ugly lookING and cheap looking made of plastic) But hey sound matter's right...EVEN THE MI EARPHONES BEAT THESE BOAT BASS HEADS they have better sound and look stylish as well.MY ADVISE US YOU GET THE SENNHEISER CX180 STREET II, AS THEY ARE BY FAR THE BEST UNDER 2K BUT COST ONLY RS.800...They have the best balance of sound, Sound the way it's meant to be heard....They are extremely popular and are light weighted and are comfortable too...They can even muffle the ambient noise....","Reviewed in India on 19 April 2018","Not as good as I thought,  Only for the LOOKS! !!","3.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NT0zhEKFL.jpg

If you cant pay for these services, download songs to phone from other sites and listen in phone. Online basic account gives you pathetic music quality.Coming to the headset, most probably you guys are like me who dont know much about highs and lows, all we care is Clarity and Bass. In that context I must say this headset is pretty ok. There is too much hype for Bass of this headset but I found it below the bass of JBL. In this headset Above 70 percentage volume, bass dominantes vocals which in turn results in a situation where you cant catch the lyrics of song. But I think normally people plays songs at 70 percentage or less.Ok I know u guys are in a hurry, so let me put it in a nut shell as follows,Physical noise cancellation 9/10Sturdiness and Hardware Quality 9/10Comfort level 8/10Aesthetic 7/10 (Personally varies)Vocals 6/10 upto 70% volume. After that pathetic.Final Verdit: If you need 90% qualityBass+ 70 % good vocals go for JBL but its not Durable. Damages easily.( Around 600₹) If you need just 75% quality bass + 60% good vocals and good durability this boat headset is an option.If you need 65 % bass + 90% Good clarity vocals Durability +Comfortness + go for One More bullets headsets. (699₹)NB: I have with me these headsets models only. Thats why I posted a comparison realted to those.

"R30NEJCBJ3DB5U","Misdaque Azdee","Okay, here is the thing. I am writing this review almost after using it for 2-3 months. Before this earphone I had House Of Marley. I was in love with that. I used it for almost 3 to 4 years and finally it wore it. I was sad.I bought this earphone expecting it to work like House of Marley but at this price it would be unfair to expect something like that still some factors could have been better.Sound quality more than average. Bass is fine. Noice cancellation is almost okay. I don't know why I felt that the earpieces were kind of heavy. It could have been lighter had they used some other material may be. Or it might be, I felt it too heavy, due to the fact my older earpiece was made up of wood and was feather light.The worst part is that when your laptop or phone is connected to charge and your laptop/phone is running on your backup power(like inverter + battery) and if you are in meeting then the microphone gives out very irritating noice which the person receiving your voice hears it. Sometimes I have to attend long meetings over zoom and have to plug in my laptop/phone to charger and then it becomes very embarassing for me. This needs to be resolved!One line review - At this price it is good. Go for it!","Reviewed in India on 10 July 2021","You can buy it!","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0",,,
"R3UEE06S6VLU3G","Marcos M.","I tested this earphones for hours and I compare with my U$100 1More and U$50 Mee pro M6. Obvious this boAT cost less than US$10 buts its interesting compare the best of earphone to see the differences. Sound quality  7 Points- The bass is fine but need more balance, for Classic music lovers or another genders also, I advice ON ear earphone but listen even on the best IN ear headphones sounds very flat. The volume is pretty good also and need to be more clear, I just tested on  the laptop to watch some movies and when there are a lot of explosion and voices, the bass makes the sound not clear. Quality 6,5 Points- The cables are long enough, that is good, but its not strong at all, the weakest part is  near the buds, this company should make strong because most people take out the headphone by holding the Cables, so if the boAt company are reading this review, just pay attention on this part, I broke dozen of headphone in this part.Usage 7 Points- Because I have used many headphones from different companies, I know how to fit properly and don t get frustrated as many people do. BoAt knowing this, send many extra pair of buds and a Small piece of RUBBER ( PAY ATTENTION) for stand the headphone and does not make it fall down, this accessory should be always there and many people dont know the purpose to be there and after complain that headphone does not fit or falls down. This is the ergo metric rubber for support in ear.Conclusion I got a gift card and I need an extra earphones to walk around and for the price of 500 rupies, I think this is a good alternative, I m not a rock roll fan and eletronic music, so, I dont need that strong bass, but to listen classic music, its necessary more crispy and balance. So, I m happy and I just request boAt to make some adjust to reinforce the cable near the buds. Anyway, the company give 1 year warranty and I hope it will cover if the parts breaks.","Reviewed in India on 9 January 2017","Review of a fanatic music listenner!","3.0 out of 5 stars","","2",,,

It can make you have a terrific headache.SOUND QUALITY-Now the SOUND QUALITY, it's surprisingly good and not bad at all, for the price they are the best sounding earphones available but their HIGHS & LOWS are terrible.

They look like some cheap earphones of the local market and they are not comfortable at all in the ear.

"R22W3TUYSP06YZ","Arun Ragothaman","Bought this recently (Nov-2017) after reading rave reviews all over the Internet. It looks like an upcoming Indian company that is sincerely trying hard to make a mark in the headphones market.Pros:- Sound Quality is excellent and unbeatable in this price range.- The Bass is very good and I could clearly hear all the small nuances and background beats in my favorite songs.- Build quality is robust. The flat cable and the L shaped headphone jack is sturdy.Cons:The biggest con is the polished metal ear phone part that you place in your ear. It's is bulky and does not sit in your ear like the usual headphone but hangs out uncomfortably. I am not a very picky guy. But, the weight of the ear phone makes it come out of the ear very easily. They have given ear hooks to compensate but that actually makes the problem worse. After a mere 45min - 1hr use my ears started hurting not because I was listening in full volume but due to the physical pressure exerted on my ears either from the earphone weight or the rubber ear hooks. During my 1 week use I tired different ways of placing the ear hooks but the discomfort and pain only got worse. I had to FINALLY RETURN THE PRODUCT. Bought sound magic ES18S hoping these issues would be addressed but that has compatibility issues since they have removed the A-B  switch.","Reviewed in India on 2 December 2017","Excellent sound quality and build but bulky and hurts ur ears!","3.0 out of 5 stars","","2",,,

"R1NSOZ2FEEUYRT","Amazon Customer","This earphone is my daily driver for almost a year and I have experienced a lots of pros and cons in it. So let's talk about the pros first.It has a great build quality. Looks more appealing than it costs. Tough cables, L-shaped jack, rugged metallic design... You'll definitely fall in love with the design. The sound quality is far above average. Not too fancy I'd say. The bass is heavy. The sound output is clear enough for this price range.Now talking about the cons , the earphone is not at all comfortable. Even though it provides a bunch of extra silicon ear tips, but the comfort is compromised somewhere. And the treble is not that good. And the most horrible part is the mic. If you are planning to have a good earphone for lots of calling through it, just don't buy it. The other person can barely hear anything. Lots of noise comes through it. Do not expect noise cancellation. You won't get it. And in my case, the speaker grill of the earpiece has fallen off. Don't know if anyone else has faced it yet.So overall, it is a pretty good deal at this price. You cannot expect a premium feel for 599 rupees right ? Do just ignore the mic if you want to buy it.

It also has a gold plated ""L"" shaped 3.5mm jack.#Fittings & Comfort: (7/10)Due it's heavy metal chassis, the earphone drops off from ear very easily. It's a kind of design flaw.

There's also a clip available inside the box.SOUND & Mic quality:Bass: (9/10)Clarity: (6/10)The tagline SUPER EXTRA BASS isn't justified. My Sound magic ES18 produced almost similar bass. Boat bass head 225 is slightly better in terms of bass. So, I'm not amazed by it. But the sound clarity of this earphone is compromised.

I was amazed and felt very happy because boat gave me very super experience and sound quality with high bass. But this time i got disappointed with boat. Bass quality reduced, treables somehow high compared with previous one. Previous time quality of cables was also nice but this time cable quality reduced too. Overall sound quality is not bad but not high as last time. I bought new by a flash sale wheather i don't know quality reduction is due to falsh sale or not.

"R3ERQLS1AVQEKT","Placeholder","To all the prospective buyers, please note this boat headset is a treat to your ears if you are looking for good sound with a great bass. Since I am not a tech geek so cannot give you comparison with other brands and I found this is good enough for my requirement under the limited budget (under 500 bucks). The cable is truly tangle free. However, the one thing that I did not like about this headset is the absence of volume adjustment button or option. This is quite a basic feature yet very important for an old school person like me. I just don't want to depend on my mobile phone for volume up/down thing. Because of that shortcoming I returned the item. I have shared my feedback with the company. I hope they will do something in this concern. Secondly, the play and pause button was not working on my headset. That was another shortcoming in my piece of item.

Well I hope this one doesn't meet the same fate well and also the buds become prone to face the same issue of easily getting tornable after quite while.

You may only face a problem if you're a professional. The outer Build quality in best for this price and other items provided are also good. The problem is that the internal build quality, the wires inside the cable and the speaker inside the bud are of really bad quality. The Earpiece won't work if any of the internal parts are damaged. So You have to be very careful with the earpiece as it's fragile. You cannot throw it away and have to keep it in a safe place. Use it very gently or else one of the earpieces would stop working. I faced this problem and bought another one but even after using it as gently as possible it still broke. So it's your call. Do you want really good Sound But at the cost of a very fragile earpiece or would rather go for a good sound and good build quality product.

But, when connected to my phone, it seemed to be working a little better. I assumed that this was maybe an issue with the ports on my laptop and phone.Over time, the audio quality started deteriorating. I had to have the jack inserted into my laptop and rotated until I could hear from both sides. When connecting it to my phone, there were times when the only thing I could hear was static, until I unplugged it, and plugged it back in again.Today was the best part of it - all of a sudden, the audio goes completely haywired, and voices became morphed into different tones altogether.The looks and design of this is quite good, but in terms of durability, it's just not worth the price. I have had headphones last me a year and a half at a minimum, and this set goes kaput within 6 months.

This one, though its sound output is decent [not as good as the one i have, but still] is not good for long use. On the first day itself, after talking for an hour or so continuously i feel pain in my ears which i never felt using my old earphone. Though some of you might like the in-ear earphones and may be comfortable with, i would recommend the first time users not to go for the in-ear type to suggest to stay away from it. Please go for the ones which stays on the ear [not over the ear] which is called the earbud type i guess so you don't face what i did. Go for the types such as Philips SHM 3100 or Philips SHE1350 or the expensive one such as Philips SHE2000/10.

Firstly left earpiece was making a lot of static noise which was very noticeable during calling and instrumental music.2. Then I ordered a replacement thinking maybe I got a defective product.3.

I decided to keep and use the product thinking maybe these are just built like this.5. After 2 days the left earpiece kept on going on/off in between the songs and hence I decided to claim the refund for the product.Hence my experience with these earphones was not at all a memorable one.Talking about earphones itself they are a bang for buck product.

They were decent at best. Neither uncomfortable nor very comfortable. Just manageable.Coming to the sound quality, now this is the tricky part.Some people will love it, some will hate it.Bass is quite good for the price. They're punchy and if you're an EDM fan or love those thumps in every music, this is the one to go with.The vocals were simply not good. Because of the extra bass, they get muffled up.

I really liked the sound quality of it when I purchased it at first, but as time passed, the constant issue of adjusting the earbud drove me crazy. It is too heavy and keeps sliding off your ears and trust me, those ear supports do not work as they are extremely painful, slip off when you are running and you cannot listen to them while sleeping on your side. The most important thing is the durability which sucks as one of my earbuds stopped working after 8 months and I cannot claim my warranty as I have lost my card.

"RY7E02IUEO3JE","P.neha devi","A few days back, on 18th of Feb 2018, I bought this earphone worth Rs 599/- only. When it comes to earphones, my requirements will be like- durable, long lasting & clear sound quality; furthermore, something extra is always welcome ex: the extra-bass 😉. Anyways, after exploring too many reviews & websites, I found this earphone on the Amazon India website & when I looked at the quality offered by the company, I was pretty amazed. Thus, I decided to buy it without any further delay. With that said, I have personally tested this earphone for two weeks now, while average two hours of listening and today I want to discuss my experience, hehe, not to mention, with due honesty. So here we go:PROS:1.ACCESSORIES:The earphones come in a nice black color box & the thing that excites me the most is their tagline ’PLUG INTO NIRVANA'. I mean, on the way to meditation. Wow! Can you imagine?When you open up the box, it has 4 things: boat earphones, 5-pairs of ear tips, ear hooks & a cable manager.2.BUILT QUALITY:Comes with an affordable price, they are surprisingly made up of METAL & feel so attractive. Yes! The product is just the same as you are looking in the picture. No difference. Also, I found that it has 3.5mm audio jack, again made up of metal. In short, to me, they seem much durable & build quality is excellent.3.AUDIO QUALITY:Overall the sound & audio experience is pretty awesome. When I tested them on my android phone & P.C, I found that the earphone does what the company claims so far. They really sound BASSY compared to other counterparts. I found, the voice is pretty much clear & it has Noise cancellation feature too, that enables you to enjoy listening music in a chaotic and noisy environment. Woo! Isn’t that great?4.CABLE & MICROPHONE:Cable is big & flat made up of rubber. It is tangle free. The microphone is incredibly good. It also includes a multifunction button & to my surprise, the button does so many things at the same time. For example, it enables me to Play or Pause the music, Changes the tracks and Answer or ends the calls immediately. Yooo! ☺5.WARRANTY: one year.CONS:1.When I used the ear tips, I found that the ear tips are somewhat inflexible & when I use them for a longer period of time, they keep coming out of my ears, For this, you must have to use ear hooks to keep them stay on for longer. There is no other option!2.The vocals are average because I think the bass overpowers the vocals, however, when I rearrange the equalizer, the problem has resolved itself.!!After lots of trial & error, I come to the point that they are a steal at this reasonable price & perform far better than the equal counterparts like JBL, skull candy, MI basic etc. I will always recommend this to all the guys & gals, who seek durability & sound-clarity, hehe, like me.😉As a whole, I am satisfied with my purchase! The seller was Appario Retail Private Ltd & the delivery was very quick, after all, it was Amazon. Happy investing guys! Hope the above review will assist you to make a right decision. If you loved my review, please do press YES as an encouragement for the reviewers like me.

"R19IB0YGIYS04C","Anubhav Saha","This is definitely one of the best budget earphone with no doubt. But there are few major cons that can be a deal-breaker for you. I'm gonna walk through every one of them, and also gonna talk about the pros of this earphone!*For one line conclusion you can just scroll down to the bottom!*CONS :-1. The L-shaped connector can be a real pain in the ass. It will interfere with the posture of the phone you will be using. Whenever you have to put your phone in pocket or place it on a plane surface with the earphones plugged in, you have to make sure that the L-shaped connector is aligned with the plane of mobile or else even a slight force on the connector would result in the earphone being disconnected and will sometimes even activate your Google Assistant and which will pause any media playing for few seconds. And when you are using the phone in landscape phone you will be forced to rotate the connector to 90 degrees for a good grip(if you are playing games).2. Next is the length and shape of the wire. Well the length is so long that it can sometimes make you irritated. It will be get stuck in any small hinge or even with your own hand. I personally have to make sure that I by mistake is not laying on the cable because its quite normal for such long wire to get at unusual places. And also the flat design will be a problem if you stay in a not very clean locality cause it will for sure collect insane amount of dust and eventually turn black(but yeah you can clean that up quite easily).PROS:-1. Well at this price point the quality of sound is amazing and yeah you can even would be able distinguish between a good streaming audio and the best quality audio. The Bass is amazing also. I've personally tried the JBL C100 (not sure about the model name though) and this earphone is quite similar to that. in view of sound quality. I have also tried out earphones worth 5000 INR and well you can'y really compare this with that.2. The second good thing is the mic of the earphone. It's quite good and it cancels quite a lot background noise also. If you are into games like PUBG Mobile or Fortnite Mobile you'll be quite satisfied while talking through  the voice chat.>>So what's the conclusion: Well if you want the best audio quality and you want to just feel the music and can trade off a bit, well this is the best you can get. If you can take care of this product then this will last more than a year and so.","Reviewed in India on 23 May 2019","**WRITING A REVIEW AFTER USING 6 MONTHS**","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0",,"Forest Green","Without Carry Case"
"R1UNVEC8EQ5IIB","DARKSTAR","If you're someone who like bass mostly while listening to music, this ear phone is for you. Loud and full of bass, I hardly used them on full volume. I'm not fan of bass or loud thumping while listening to songs...but still enjoyed my playlists of various genres with it. Good for even enjoying movies and mobile gaming. Metal finish and flat wire makes it premium in this price range...although I like it but I want to mention that because of metal earplugs...it is a-bit heavy on ear and can cause pain on long use, also you don't enjoy it while you lay down side ways...as it pokes in ear (metallic-nature) causes pain. So keep it all in mind.This beautiful looking earphones comes with in-line mic and buttons that work as playback controls.The product package contains extra ear buds which are in various sizes( S, M & L). Overall it's a great product in my opinion. I got it for ₹499.","Reviewed in India on 17 July 2023","Best for Bass lovers, Metal-finish, Flat wire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","4",,,
"RXPTM0RFBBJQ7","Hemanth Shenoy","I've been using a lot of in ear headphones throughout my time. After my excellent JBL T110A was toast on one ear side, I had to look for a replacement.​This time, I didn't want to only focus on the audio output, but also on the build quality of the earphones themselves. I was done with these cables breaking off and going deaf at one ear all the time. So I found these, the bassheads 225 from a company called boAt.Like most people, I'm all about dat bass! So I wanted to make sure that these headphones were as good as my earlier JBLs. So are they better?Well, yes and no. They are certainly more rugged and durable. The flat cable is both thicker and more sturdy than the JBL' s flimsy round cables. These can take quite a lot of abuse, and still work just fine.The standard 11 mm drivers on these buds certainly have some manner of bass boost to them. They sound almost equal to any other pair of earphones in this price range.​Sure, my JBLs were slightly superior in matters of pure bass. But these aren't slouches either. Provided you have a good DAC on your phone/device, you just need to use a decent equalizer with these, and you can 'hear' wonders.They also have an inline one button microphone, to receive calls. The microphone is quite decent and the audio on the other end is quite acceptable in quality.There doesn't seem to be any noise cancellation on board, as I can pretty much hear the surrounding sounds. That never bothered me at all, as I like to be in touch with the surrounding world, a little bit! If you want serious noise cancelling buds, you should probably skip these bassheads.I did run into a small issue with the right ear tip size. There are multiple sized ear buds included within the package. But I found that the ones installed were a size too small, and the immediate next ones were a bit too big, at least for my ears.As a result, these weren't a perfect fit in my ear all the time. They slip out of my ears quite easily. Especially when I'm travelling, I find myself picking them up to tuck them back into my ears, more times than usual. So I swapped my old ear buds from the JBLs onto these, and now I'm good.These have been under my careless, abusive ownership for almost 4 months now. I'm happy to say that they're still perfectly intact and fully functional. That was my original intention and so should be yours, if you're gonna buy these.These earphones are geared more to people who want a long lasting pair with good sound quality, than a flimsy, delicate pair with great sound quality. And at the price of just 699 INR, you certainly won't be disappointed with the boAt bassheads 225.","Reviewed in India on 6 August 2017","Are these any good?

"R3MC4U6R5RBZY6","Yash","So after a week of use & testing its REVIEW-TIME.===============1.) DELIVERY:- This was my first order from Amazon.in . I ordered it on 16th April afternoon & expected delivery was by 19th . However, they delivered it a day before on 18th noon. Packaging was pretty good with a bubble over the packet. Hence, totally satisfied with Amazon.==============2.) Boat Basshead 225 In-Ear extra bass Earphones :- So now coming to the actual product . At a pricepoint of Rs. 499/- they provide a complete box , along with plastic slots inside where earphones are intact (check images). Pretty good!.So here is  what you get inside the box :-1.) Boat basshead 225 In-Ear extra bass earphones2.) 6 pairs of different size earbud eartips (one fitted with the main unit & 5 other)3.) A collar clip for holding mic.4.) A over ear holder (rubber)5.) A BOAT warranty card.===============3.) Actual product (main unit) testing & usage review :-So, i simply plugged it in my Mi 3s & started listening to it. Initially i got to know that bass was amazing (as they say). Listened to some songs of 320kbps for getting to know true knowledge of earphones. However it started to feel a lil uncomfortable. So i swapped over some eartips & found the best fit for my ear. & then believe me it was completely amazing. Bass was lil extra but it does not ruins or overpowers the vocals. Noise cancellation is awesome.I watched a movie over it for 2 & a half hours & it was completely comfortable throughout, hence a good experience.With some appropriate equaliser settings & volume level, it just becomes beast. At high volumes, sound might feel a lil bursted since bass overpowers the vocals.Even during movement of the body, it keeps good hold over your ear , jus make sure for right size eartips. They even provide a over-ear holder too if in case it slips.Final verdict:-.Bass lovers will love to have it at such an amazing pricepoint of Rs 499/- . I can't compare it with other brands like JBL or Skullcandy but can compare with Sony over-the ear headphones MDR-ZX (white old model) & this one is the clear winner in both , noise cancellation & sound quality as well.If this review helps you in some or the other, please do hit the Helpful button. :)Thanks for reading.","Reviewed in India on 25 April 2017","The Budget Bass Beast 😍","4.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51wOcnNGAmL.jpg

"R3USQJ999XSD32","Siddharth Sethi","DELIVERY and PACKAGING:The earphone box came in bubble plastic Amazon pouch.IN THE PACK:- Earphones- Set of 6 ear buds (one already attached)- A support clip and ear supportREVIEW:Reading a lot of positive reviews, I thought of trying the earphones myself when I had requirement for a daily use earphone.When you open the package, you see a small well packed earphone box with lot of ear buds (lots because normally you get 3 sets but here we have 6) and some other small accessories.After hearing to music via my Sony MP3 player and phone for few days, I would say the bass is nice and better than any other earphone in this price, but calling it extra bass would be too much. The sounds are clear and the plugs do a decent job in cancelling the surrounding noise.I tried using the earplug support so that that they don’t fall of my ear. For a while it was ok and felt good, but after few hours it somehow started to pain. Maybe I was not using it correctly, or it’s a design fault, but I ended up removing those.The provided ear buds provided were good but I still felt need for something better which could be softer. After trying many combinations but I ended up using the buds from my old Sony earphones. The noise cancellation was better, the sounds beats improved, and fall frequency of the earphones from my ear significantly dropped.PROS:- The wires are good. Tangle free flat cable- The bass is better than any other earphones (with mic) in this price point.- The sound quality is good enough for these earphones to be a daily accessory.- Mic is good and people were able to hear me good in crowded places as well- The mic button feedback is good and works as expectedCONS:- The earbud quality could have been better for better fit.- The earplug support could use a better design for longer wearing.VERDICT:For the price you pay, I would  say there could be no other alternate. The sound quality is good and decent base. Even it has few cons, but nothing of a deal breaker.Please hit the “YES” button If you found this Review Helpful. It encourages me to inspect more and more products so that you could buy only the Right Products.","Reviewed in India on 18 October 2017","Good base (not extra) and decent quality with some cons that can be ignored","4.0 out of 5 stars","","3",,,
"R3HPTH408SSCKN","MADHU KIRAN","After many days of research on good ear phones finally I decided to buy  BOAT BASE HEADS 225.....I have been using boat ear phones from past 15 days..I believe this 15days is enough to judge the performance of this product. Design and build quality.: 10/10 ( considering price the range ) I ordered black varrient , as usually black brings fantastic  look to this . Flat cable with soft rubber texture and metal made ear piece with gold colour 3.5 mm jack along with the MIC added  the premium look to the ear phones.thanks to the flat cable for saved me from Tangles.. :)Sound quality and base :  9/10I'm used this earphones with Moto .Lenovo, ViVO and Redmi 4 , Redmi note 4 ,I phone 5s and 6s .All the phones produces good output through this.Due to its extra base ,it is providing good sound .even you are in a hidh traffic you can clearly listen the audio without any noise.While listening the Bollywood and western music it gives awesome feeling..wherein, for music like melodies and other soft music it is not much impressive and also the performance of Mic is not upto the mark.Price and durability  :  10/10Even though I bought this product 15days ago...I'm used this product very badly.it feel down many times from pocket and Hits the floor many times..but nothing was happen to this .Comfortness and ease of use :7/ 10.Due to the flat cable it is very easy hold and carry ,no issues like wire Tangles.However I experienced an issue with  the ear piece like other users ,The ear piece is easily coming out from the ear very easily .( As per my usage experience I faced this issue  twice in every 14 mins).However you can minimise this issue by using different extra ear bud sets provided by Boat for free along with the package. And theFinally if you are looking for a great ear phones with Mic price  under 600 bucks , for modearte use with high durability please go for this.If you are a music lover and you listen the music most of the time in a day ..don't go for this.","Reviewed in India on 1 August 2017","Good ear phones for Great price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0",,,

"R2GSFCZ4VEQFC8","Srivats","I bought the older version of Boat BassHeads 225 in Amazon almost 19 months ago. It worked perfectly fine without a single issue till last week.  Beacuse, unfortunately one of the earbud (with inline mic) stopped working along with the mic too! One cannot expect to last this earphones for such a long period of 19 months for such a low price compared to other high end earphones. Thanks to it's good but not great durability. I am saying this because the L shaped audio jack and the rubber price that connects the flat cable to the aluminium body of the earbuds weared out. But other than this issue, was pretty much happy with it's performance.This time I decided to buy the same earphones because it had upgraded the design in the areas where I found the issues in the older one. And I expected the same audio profile from the new one too. But damn!!! I was wrong.Boat has done a really good job in tweaking the bass in the new version. You can easily identify the difference in the bass when compared to the older model. You won't find it too overwhelming and it has got the perfectly balanced bass at this price budget. The higs are also pretty decent and nice to hear.But one cone which it retained was that it's mids is not improved like the bass. The vocals are little bit  muddy amdt unclear when the song which you are playing has chorus. So, if you are a serious music lover and looking for more vocal clarity , spend some extra bucks to get earphones with more vocals clarity or good mids.P.S:The reason why I decided to stick with these earphones is that I mainly use them to watch videos, play games and listen to songs sometimes when bored. I am musician too but I actually LOVE the audio profile in this earphones But if you are a serious audio profile freak, this isn't not the piece for you. But it won't disappoint you at the same time.

"R2RMVPGT3V2G7R","Nikhil","I've personally used Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones for more than two weeks (average daily two hours of listening) before writing this review and I'm pretty much impressed with them. I'm personally a fan of Extra Bass IEM's and currently, my primary IEM is Sony MDR-XB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category. Comparing Sony MDR-XB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didn't disappoint me, obviously it doesn't stand a chance in front of Sony MDR-XB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225 & the quality they offer, I was really very impressed. Boat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices & music players, I can say that they're amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. The bass output is amazing and is very intense, I'll recommend using correct size ear tips & good quality music player like Poweramp (Android) for better bass output. The treble is good & vocals are average, somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. The mids are again average. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>Taking everything into account, overall I'm very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225. The Built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass & good overall soundstage.

Overall the vocal & highs are good & mids are average but still good for the price. I'll recommend these IEM's to bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price. Genres like EDM, Rock, Hip-Hop sound really great on them.

It sometimes gets stuck. I am a fairly tall guy and still I find it long.3_ Not the most comfortable earphones.

The wire got detached from the microphone. Although I registered a complaint, and they picked up my product to get it repaired, and later called me to say that they don't repair it.

"R27ZSNF65GQKKQ","Stamewo","I have used boat products previously and suddenly all my friends have started recommending me Boat’s products. I work in the Film industry where the sound is one of the most essential elements and no matter whether you have or have not, a good earphone is a must.Apple gives good earphones but they break after a while but the sound quality they provide is excellent. The problem is that first, they are super expensive and second, they don't last long.Most other earphones in the same range will give far inferior product and their sound quality is so bad that it will only damage your eardrums and give your headaches. Here is a detailed view of why I find the Boat earphones to be one ofthe best that there is –------Pros If you are ordering from Amazon, then you have a well packed good product in your hands. I have also found that I am unable to find the Boat products easily in the general market. Wires are like strap, flat and very strong. Unlike earphones which gives you a rubbery feeling, these earphones will give you more of a plastic feeling. The wire does not coil itself and if it does, it is easy to open it because of the of the smooth strapped flat shape of wires. The sound is amazing. It does not break even when I took the volume a little higher. They are easily stuck on ears and does not fall off. The wire is long enough for you to put laptop one side and watch movies from a distance. The microphone is also awesome as I sang songs and made voice notes, for which it was clear and precise. Sometimes more than required. It even captured my breathing sound from a distance. The earbuds have a metallic look and are strong. There is no question you have to buy another earphone for an entire year. It comes with an entire set of different custom earbud covers. It helps because different people have different ear sizes and according to them they can use it for their ears. It also comes with cervical ear support which helps in putting an earbud to connect more impactfully to your ear without giving you pain. It helps if you don’t want earbuds to fall in case of strong movements. Most important, though the price is less, the boat products do not look very cheap and boasts of a good brand name.------Cons Are you kidding me? Till now there are no cons for me. With the price tag attached to it, it is literally the best bargain you can get on an earphone. My brother has two of them in different colours and loves them.------Final OpinionDon’t think twice before ordering it. There are tremendously good reviews all over for Boat products and lately, I have seen more and more people leaning towards this product. I cannot tell you how many people have recommended me this earphone and those friends of mine have never faced any problem of any kind.Without a doubt, the best company that there is today on Amazon. If you are planning to buy it, do it. You won't regret it.------","Reviewed in India on 31 January 2019","Boat provides one of the best sound products on Amazon","5.0 out of 5 stars","","6",,,

"R1IK54YI61WKKU","Samik Bhattacharya","I have used earbuds since my Sony Walkman series phone introduced me to earbuds. I'm not a huge ""bass-freak"" so this pair was amazing. I still use the same model even though this particular earbud lasted me only a year. Then I accidentally pulled one of the wires out which was totally my bad. But if you can take care of these, they can last you a really long time! I have used it in various scenarios and the sound quality is fantastic (I listen to a lot of Rock and Roll and Orchestral music, No beats in my playlist). The best at this price point. On a side note, I think all the earphones of this price range have caught up to the quality. This specific earphones come in a very good form factor and low profile black which I really prefer.","Reviewed in India on 6 June 2024","Really Great utility earphones","5.0 out of 5 stars","","2",,,

"R59QMSI4WOIES","Amazon Customer","I recently bought Boat earphones.I purchased it second time.My first Boat earphones delivered great user experience nearly for three years. So this time also I went for the same.The packaging was good and earphones' build quality is rugged. The rubber coat on cables avoid tangling of the same. As usual Boat has also provided three extra pairs of ear cups of various sizes to suit your ears. This certainly enhances the user experience as the gesture shows that Boat cares for it's customers.The important thing I observed this time is that the sound quality of the earphones is improved a lot. Previously also the sound quality was good but this time it's observed that it has been further improved with improved Bass effect without compromising the overall Treble effect. That's a good thing.Price wise also Boat earphones is certainly a best deal.Highly recommended. 👍","Reviewed in India on 12 March 2024","Superb quality earphones by Boat","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xS52-QTyL.jpg","3",,"Blue","With Carry Case"

Looks like they'll last quite long.
